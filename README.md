## Overview

My Board is a backend API server designed for crawling and analyzing community sites. The project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to extract and analyze data from various online communities.

## Motivation

I started this project out of my passion for data analysis and community engagement. As an enthusiast in online communities, I saw the need for a tool that could efficiently gather and analyze data from these platforms. My Board aims to fill that gap and provide a flexible and powerful solution for community site crawling and analysis.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for static typing.
- **Nest.js**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system used for storing crawled data.

## Roadmap

- Add address information for accessing the project's site once it's up and running.
